🤖 Macro Intelligence Engine (MIE)An automated pipeline to synthesize global macro sentiment from leading financial podcasts.📌 Project OverviewThe Macro Intelligence Engine is a data engineering project that automates the collection and synthesis of unstructured audio data from elite finance podcasts (Odd Lots, The Market Huddle, Macro Voices). It leverages Gemini 1.5 Pro to identify market "consensus" vs. "divergence" in the Forex and Bond markets, providing a weekly actionable summary for traders.🎯 The ProblemMacro traders face "Information Overload." Listening to 10+ hours of professional podcasts weekly is unsustainable. MIE reduces 10 hours of audio to a 5-minute technical brief, highlighting specific trade risks and conflicting expert takes.🏗️ ArchitectureThe pipeline is built on a modular "Ingest-Process-Distill" architecture:Ingest: A Python script (using yt-dlp) monitors a sources.json registry for new episodes.Process: Audio is processed through the Gemini 1.5 Pro API using its 2M token context window to ingest multiple transcripts simultaneously.Distill: A structured prompt categorizes insights into:Consensus: Shared views on Fed policy and rates.Divergence: Conflicting takes on FX (e.g., USD direction).Outliers: Radical "tail risk" theories.Action: The engine maps these insights against a user-defined positions.yaml to flag specific trade risks.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.11+Orchestration: GitHub Actions (Cron-scheduled every Monday 08:00 AM)AI Model: Google Gemini 1.5 ProData Handling: YAML for position tracking, Markdown for briefing delivery🚀 Quick Start1.
